# DBMS-Delitaste-Pizza-Project 
Physical Database Design 

In this assignment, steps in the physical database design are conducted (as described below) 
as well as revising the concept database design and logic database design of assignment 1 
and assignment 2, and a final report of the project is written. 
 
This assignment has 3 parts as specified below. 
1. Revise the concept database design and logic database design, based on your revision and 
the feedback provided by your marker.  
 
1.1  Write a Concept  database  design,  including  Requirement  Specification  (including  data  
requirements,  transaction  requirements  and  business  rules),  and  EER  Diagram  and  Data  
Dictionary. 
 
1.2 Map the EER model to the relational model. Document the relational schema in 
DBDL  
 
1.3 Normalize the relational schema to Boyce-Codd Normal Form (Point out what norm 
form each relation is in, do the normalisation if any relation is not already in BCNF.). The 
final normalised schema must be documented in DBDL.  
  
2.  Complete major steps in the physical database design 

 2.1 Write SQL scripts that create the normalised Delitaste Pizza database, 
including all necessary tables with the right parameters such as primary key, 
foreign key, default value.  

 2.2 Write SQL statements satisfying the transaction requirements including: 
 
  2.2.1 Input proper data (as you consider legitimate) of at least three rows 
for every table, and 
 
  2.2.2 Implement the following queries (make sure to populate with 
enough and proper data into related tables so that non-void result is 
shown for each query. 
 
  Q.1  For  a  delivery  staff  with  id  number  xxx,  print  his/her  
1stname, lname, and hourly payment rate. 
  
  Q.2 List all the ingredient details of a menu item named xxx. 
  
  Q.3  List  all  the  shift  details  of  a  delivery  staff  with  first  name  
xxx and last name ttt between date yyy and zzz 
  
  Q.4  List  all  the  order  details  of  the  orders  that  are  made  by  a 
walk-in customer with first name xxx and last name ttt between 
date yyy and zzz. 
  
  Q.5 List all the order details of the orders that are taken by an 
in-office  staff  with  first  name  xxx  and  last  name  ttt  between  
date yyy and zzz. 
  
  Q.6  Print  the  salary  paid  to  a  delivery  staff  named  xxx  in  the 
current month. Note the current month is the current month that 
is decided by the system. 
  
  Q.7 List the name of the ingredient that is mostly ordered in the 
current  year.  Note  the  current  year  is  the  current  year  that  is  
decided by the system. 

3. Write a final report. The final report should include all the content of the above two 
tasks, including all the SQL scripts. 
 
The final report should include the following: 

1. Requirement Specification (including data requirements, transaction requirements 
and business rules).  

2. EER Diagram and Data Dictionary 

3. Map the EER model to the relational model. Document the relational schema in 
DBDL. Give normalized relational schema in DBDL. Ensure that normalisation 
steps are shown.  

4. SQL script (both in your sql file and in your Word report file) which creates the 
Delitaste Pizza database as stated in 2.1.  

5. SQL statements (both in your sql file and in your Word report file) satisfying the 
transaction requirements as stated in 2.2
